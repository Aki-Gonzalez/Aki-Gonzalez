                <p>
                    <!-- A taskforce brainstormed some ideas for the UI/UX of the game:<br> -->
                    <b>Menus and UI: their purpose:</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Main Menu<br>
                    The main menu was set to be a part of the first area for the game, the cottage. Immediately placing and immersing the player into the world.<br>
                    As the menu is navigated a camera moves to various postions within the cottage, allowing elements such as the title of the game and a credits group photo to be diegetic.<br>
                    Pressing play transitions the camera to where the player is supposed to start the level.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Pause Menu<br>
                    Pauses the game while still showing the environment of the level.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    HUD<br>
                    A centered sprite that changes depending on if something is interactable or not, similar to our reference game SOMA.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    IronWrought does not have support for doing all the goals the group had for the UI. I opted to not expand on existing systems of the engine which allowed faster prototyping and end results at the cost of flexibility.  
                    A scene in IronWrought can hold one set of UI elements: a canvas. The idea being that a scene has a purpose and the canvas is tied to that purpose. The workaround was to have all necessary canvases ready and swap which one the scene held to fit the state of the game.
                    The sprite change on the hud is handled in a specific case through IronWrought's post master, there were different objects that could affect which sprite to display.

                <h3>Monster: Attacking the Player</h3>
                <p>
                    When the monster reaches the player, or perhaps the player bumps into the monster out of curiosity, the monster reacts by grabbing the player.
                    I setup the process for the event. Positioning and orienting both the player and the monster to work with the monster's animation at the start of it.
                    Teleporting the monster to a nearby spawnpoint once finished and leaving the player in where it was at the start. 
                    <!-- I worked with Josephine Eriksson, the artist who animated the monster to work out the details of the animation for the event and what restrictions there were.
                    Nicolas Risberg worked in parallell with me to fix the screen effect when looking at the monster, which we tweaked to work together with the event. -->

                <h3>Monster: Animations</h3>
                <p>
                    Reused the AI animation controller from <a href="sp7.html">I AM</a> to connect animations to the monster's various states.<br>
                    Whenever the monster changed states (example: Patrol to Seek) the animation controller would receive a message with some data regarding the state.<br>
                    The data most often being where between 2 animations the animation should start. For example Seek, running with arms behind or reaching forward, would pass a % value: currentDistanceToPlayer / closeToPlayerMinimum on first entering the state and during updates.<br>

                    <b>Monster: Hearing Player Footsteps</b>
                    <br>
                    The monster could hear both objects being thrown around and the player.<br>
                    The monster received the players playStepSound message along with data describing either walk or sprint which determines the hearing range. Comparing the squared distance between the monster and sound origin to the squared hearing range.

                    <!-- <b>Prototype: Seamless Level Transitions</b>
                    <br>
                    <i>Goal:</i><br> 
                    * Seamless level transitions: Ambition to walk across all levels without loadingscreens
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <i>Restrictions:</i><br>
                    * IronWrought was built for single levels.<br>
                    * Monster was built to work in a single level environment.<br>
                    * Puzzles were worked on and tested for single level environment.<br>
                    * Levels were supposed to still be playable by themselves.<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>What I Did:</i><br>
                    Scenes (holds GameObects, handles update of them and passes along active objects to rendering) were split into sections using a map.
                    Created volume triggers that switched active sections.
                    Later on when issues with traversal across levels became an issue due to the group wanting the level to change, teleporters were added. Which were just instant loading screens.
                    <br>
                    I messed up. Did not communicate well enough. It wasn't the entire groups desire, It was mine and Axels. We split the work and I went to tackle it by myself. I did not think it through and started working 
                    before listing the things above. If I had created a list like I've done above things would have been clear from the start.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Why It Failed:</i><br>
                    Trying to make a system work in a way it was not intended to. Larger, engine wide changes would have had to be made to support several scenes. Or change the way we built scenes in Unity.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>What Could Have Been Done To Make It Work:</i><br>
                    PostMaster would have had to have support for sections.<br>
                    GameObjects had Awake(), Start(), IsActive(). Adding a Sleep() would have resolved some issues with the monster and puzzles; instead of section toggling calling IsActive(true/false) it would have been Awake()/Sleep().
                    However, there were many GameObects and many Components. Not sure how long it would take.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Additional Thoughts:</i><br>
                    The moment teleporters were discussed the question should have been brought up: is there any point to this? Teleporting around is close to loading levels anyway. Our loading times aren't long so there is not really much of
                    a reason to have it. -->
