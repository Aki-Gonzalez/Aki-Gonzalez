                <h3>Specialization: Color customization</h3>
                <p>
                As part of the curriculum at The Game Assembly we got to work on something that interests us. 
                For me that was color customization similar to what can be found in many games.
                <br>
                Languages: C++, HLSL. Graphics API: DirectX11 - 5 weeks half time.

                <h3>Introduction: Goals</h3>
                <p> 
                    My goals were to be able to tint a models underlying albedo map with a couple of colors that cover
                    different areas, have control over emissive and possibly to also blend in another texture.
                    An artist is to have control over which areas are to be tinted.
                    With an editor and an orbit camera the colors and textures would be edited in-engine.
                    I wanted to make something that could be used for our upcoming game project 8 so I used
                    IronWrought, the engine my group SoftBlob created for our game projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I planned 3 weeks of with goals for each day that I later estimated time for and used as tasks.
                    1st week: create a model, store colors in our model component-class, save & load using json.
                    2nd week: editor with interface using Dear ImGui, orbit camera.
                    3rd week: refactoring and improvements.
                    Fourth & fifth weeks: textures and portfolio work.

                <h3>How to control which areas are to be tinted: a tint map</h3>
                <p> 
                    I wasnâ€™t sure where or how I would start. And decided that I would look for a reference game.
                    I decided on Warframe [Digital Extremes] cause I remembered that they use tint maps. Which they thoroughly
                    explain for their Tennogen program (community created cosmetics).
                    <br>      
                    Each channel of the tint map texture creates a mask that controls which areas are to be tinted.
                    I then lerp between the the original albedo map, textures and the colors.
                    The one that is last in the lerp-blend order becomes more prominent. I wanted the color to properly tint the texture
                    so I placed it last, allowing me to tint a texture that is blue to be red.

                <p> 
                    With IronWrought we use RapidJSON for parsing most things which works well since the files are
                    readable outside of the editor. The serialization and deserialization is handled inside the class that 
                    holds the model-data to keep it consistent with how the rest of the components work in IronWrought.

                <h3>Orbit Camera</h3>
                <p>
                    The camera was tricky to get how I wanted it. I used Autodesk Mayas camera behaviour as reference.
                    I underestimated the time it would take to get the camera to an acceptable working state.
                    Was alot of fun, I've wanted to create a camera like this for a while. My main struggle with it was
                    understanding spherical coordinate systems. I don't fully understand it yet but I've got a start.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    I am satisfied with the results, although I feel there is a lot of room for improvent.
                    The editor does what it needs to, even if it is a bit simple.
                    I think it might have some use for the next game project
                    Dear ImGui is wonderful to work with.

                </p>
                <h3>Improvements I wish to make</h3>
                <p>
                    I think the lack of a proper folder browser might make the editor furstrating to use.
                    Dear ImGui has no built-in folder broweser so either I download an addon or create my own. 
                    <br>
                    There are also optimizations that I could do for storing and handling data.
                    I should also separate the tinted model data into its own from the default model component.
