                <h3>Animation Blending - Animation State Machine</h3>
                <p>
                    Created a light-weight state machine for the player and the enemies in the game.
                    <br>
                    For the player I made a component that holds some states and adjusts animations based on those states. Function calls from other components toggled these states and updated necessary values.
                    <br><br>
                    With some of the graphics artist I sat and worked out what could be done with the system and on some ideas for the blending between animations for the player as well as figuring out some issues with the system.
                    <br>
                    Example in the gif above of the pull function of the gravity glove (the players main tool for interacting with the world) where the distance of the object to the glove was used to change the animation.
                    <br><br>
                    The enemies all share a central controller that receives which state the ai is in and changes animations accordinlgy.  
                </p>

                    <b>Player</b><br>
                    Player movement, crouch and health regeneration. Crouch is toggled on CTRL and works by resizing the collider, lowering the collider and the movement speed.
                    Health regeneration triggers after a couple of seconds and regenerates x% per second until the player has taken damage or health is maxed out. 
                    Also tweaked movement. Created functions for story events.<br>
                    I AM's player was a collaboration between several members working on different parts and iterations of them.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Widget Support for UI System</b><br>
                    I setup the menus and related states and together with <b>Nicolas Risberg</b> worked out the idea of widgets for our menus to support the concept created by our artists.<br>
                    IronWrought has a class: <i>CCanvas</i> which is used for UI. It holds sprites, buttons, text and more. Widgets are any instances of CCanvas held by another main CCanvas.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Node Editor</b><br>
                    I helped <b>Haqvin Bager</b> with the <a href="https://haqvinbager.github.io/I_Am.html">node editor</a> on a couple of bugs and some optimizations.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>VFX System Changes</b><br>
                    For I AM the team wanted to expand our vfx system and creating an <a href="https://nicolas-risberg.github.io/2021-03-30/vfx-editor.html">editor</a> for the system was on the graphics artists' wishlist. Together with <b>Nicolas Risberg</b> we moved particles and 
                    vfx-meshes into a single Component to create the base for the editor to work on. We added support for the particle emitters and vfx-meshes to rotate and translate in relation to the transform of the GameObject and each other. 
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Deferred Rendering</b><br>
                    Converted model and instanced model rendering to use a deferred renderer instead so IronWrought. 
                    In parts I worked together with <a href="https://haqvinbager.github.io/">Haqvin Bager</a> and <a href="https://nicolas-risberg.github.io/">Nicolas Risberg</a> to resolve specific issues.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Detail Normals</b><br>
                    <b>Haqvin Bager</b> and I setup support for detail normals in IronWrought. Based on the cameras distance to an object up to 4 different normal maps can be blended into a models material to allow for more detail and variation.
