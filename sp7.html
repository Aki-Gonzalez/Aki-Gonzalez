                    <br> 
                    Team: SoftBlob, 16 people (7 programmers, 4 level designers, 5 graphics artists)<br>
                    Genre: FPX<br>
                    Duration: 16 weeks half time<br>
                    Languages: C++, HLSL<br>
                    Graphics API: DirectX11<br>
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Second game developed in IronWrought.<br>
                    The engine has been improved upon from our last project. It now has support for PhysX, detail normals,<br>
                    blended animations and node scripting. Reference game: Half Life 2. Visual reference: Valorant.

                <h3>Detail Normals</h3>
                <p>
                    Developed with Haqvin Bager.<br>
                    Provided with guidance from The Game Assembly. We went through their modelviewer<br>
                    code to figure out how to proceed. The normals are supposed to blend into the underlying<br>
                    normal map based on proximity from the camera.<br>
                    <code>
                        float strengthMultiplier = 0.0f;<br>
                        float dist = distance(eyePos, vertWorldPos);<br>
                        strengthMultiplier = clamp((1.0f / (dist * dist)), 0.0f, DETAILNORMAL_DISTANCE_MAX);
                    </code>
                    Additionally, a material should be able to use 4 different detail normals.<br>
                    Which normal to use where is determined using the opacity of the material maps alpha channel<br>
                    <br>
                    This was a requirment for the project; every group has some variation of it.<br>
                    I mostly included it here cause I thought it was really cool.

                <h3>Blended Animations</h3>
                <p>
                    In the previous project there were some issues getting blended animations<br>
                    to work properly (because of lack of understanding from my part).<br>
                    This project I got it up and running.<br>
                    The system allows for blending between 2 animations or playing a single animation.<br>
                    We had some issues when we upgraded our asset importer which gave some funny results.<br>
                    <br>
                    It was tricky to figure out that it was an issue within the importer. I dug around inside <br>
                    of the controller to find the root cause with no luck, with some help from other programmers<br>
                    we tried with later versions of fbx:es. Which seemed to work, for the most part.<br>
                    Rotations were incorrect when a skeleton had its joints oriented so as not facing the <br>
                    same direction as world space. After some attempts to resololve this myself I decided to <br>
                    change the importer we used. Asked for some advice on how to use CMake and now it works fine.<br>
