                <h3>Blended Animations</h3>
                <p>
                    Blends between 2 animations at a time.<br>
                    I made some minor changes to the system from our previous project (SPITE: Bloodloss) as well as making sure it worked with our deferred renderer. I then got it setup to work with the player and the enemies.
                    <br><br>
                    With some of the graphics artist I sat and worked out what could be done with the system and on some ideas for the blending between animations for the player as well as figuring out some issues with the system.
                    <br><br>
                    For the <b>player</b> I made a component that holds some states and adjusts animations based on those states, a light-weight state machine. Function calls from other components toggled these states.
                    The blending of the animation is done by lerping.
                    Example in the gif above of the pull function of the gravity glove (the players main tool for interacting with the world) where the distance of the object to the glove was used to change the animation.
                    <br><br>
                    The <b>enemies</b> all share a central controller that receives which state an enemy is in and a desired animation using our PostMaster-event system.

                <p>
                    Player<br>
                    I along with a couple of others in the team worked on the player. Main contributions were crouch and health regeneration. Crouch is toggled on CTRL and works by resizing the collider, lowering the collider and the movement speed.
                    Health regeneration triggers after a couple of seconds and regenerates x% per second until the player has taken damage or health is maxed out. Also tweaked movement and fixed a couple of bugs.
                    <br><br>
                    Deferred Rendering<br>
                    I worked together with <a href="https://haqvinbager.github.io/">Haqvin Bager</a> and <a href="https://nicolas-risberg.github.io/">Nicolas Risberg</a> to move IronWrought from using a forward renderer to a deferred renderer.
                    <br><br>
                    Widget Support for UI System<br>
                    I setup the menus and related states and together with <b>Nicolas Risberg</b> worked out the idea of widgets for our menus to support the concept created by our artists.<br>
                    IronWrought has a class: <i>CCanvas</i> which is used for UI. It holds sprites, buttons, text and more. Widgets are any instances of CCanvas held by another main CCanvas.
                    <br><br>
                    Node Editor<br>
                    I helped <b>Haqvin Bager</b> with the <a href="https://haqvinbager.github.io/I_Am.html">node editor</a> on a couple of bugs and some optimizations.
                    <br><br>
                    VFX System Changes<br>
                    For I AM the team wanted to expand our vfx system and creating an <a href="https://nicolas-risberg.github.io/2021-03-30/vfx-editor.html">editor</a> for the system was on the graphics artists' wishlist. Together with <b>Nicolas Risberg</b> we moved particles and 
                    vfx-meshes into a single Component to create the base for the editor to work on. We added support for the particle emitters and vfx-meshes to rotate and translate in relation to the transform of the GameObject and each other. 
                    <br><br>
                    Detail Normals<br>
                    <b>Haqvin Bager</b> and I setup support for detail normals in IronWrought. Based on the cameras distance to an object up to 4 different normal maps can be blended into a models material to allow for more detail and variation.
