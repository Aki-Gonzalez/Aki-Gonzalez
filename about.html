                    Looking for Work.<br>
                    Completed my studies at The Game Assembly - Stockholm, Game Programming.<br>
                    Recently finished Generalist Programmer Internship at ZenzVR.<br>
                </p>
                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>
                    Video games have been a large part of my life ever since I held a Gameboy Advance for the first time, curious about what
                    makes up a game I got into game development.  
                    I am currently a generalist programmer. With knowledge of C++ and C#, experience with development in Unity and custom engines
                    I hope to realize ideas and designs into playable experiences.
                    <br> <br>
                    During my internship at ZenzVR I've worked in Unity to implement various features and systems for XR development as well as setting up a project for development on the Nintendo Switch.
                    <br>
                    At The Game Assembly I've explored various roles in programming such as gameplay, UI/UX, tools, AI and more through assigments and projects. 
                    8 smaller projects where I've collaborated with level designers, artists and other programmers.
