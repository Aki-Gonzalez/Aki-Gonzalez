                <h3>Current status</h3>
                <p> 
                    2nd year of studies at The Game Assembly - Stockholm, Game Programming.<br>
                    Looking for an internship for the period August 2021 - April 2022.<br>
                </p>
                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p> 
                    Growing up playing video games I wondered what was going on behind the curtains. From thinking that it was magic to now understanding the logic and all the thought
                    that goes into creating them. Even if it not powered by magic I find them interesting and fun to work on.<br>
                    I hope to explore, learn and create more as part of a team.
                    <br><br>
                    <!-- I got my first introduction to game development and programming while studying at <a href="https://www.bth.se/utbildning/program/udgta/">Blekinge Institute of Technology</a> as part of the Techincal Artist in Games program.
                    , although at the time I leaned more towards the graphical side.
                    <br><br> -->
                    Through the projects and the courses at The Game Assembly I have had the opportunity to work on many different areas of game programming such as gameplay, tools, AI and more.
                    I've been a part of 7 game projects, starting on the 8th, as part of various teams. 2 projects in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> for pc and android using C#, 3 projects in The Game Assembly's
                    own engine Tga2D using C++ and the final 3 in IronWrought using C++ created by <a href="softblob.html">SoftBlob Studios</a>.
                    The projects have been both on site and remote, requiring different solutions for it work.
                    <br><br>
                    I believe teamwork is the core of game development, having discussions to form solutions and come up with ideas shapes a game. Some of the most fun I've had is talking about how to approach a problem, sketching solutions for it and setting it into motion.
                    Getting input and feedback from anyone in the team is central and something I put a lot of effort into, making sure others feel their work is appreciated and that I listen to what they have to say about what I do so that it can become something greater.
                    My main drive when working on a project is making sure things work.
