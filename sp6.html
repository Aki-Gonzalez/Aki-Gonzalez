                    SPITE: Bloodloss.<br>
                    The 6th game project at The Game Assembly. The first with a custom 3D engine: IronWrought.<br>
                    SPITE is the shared name for this project, all groups use Diablo as a reference game.<br>

                <h3>About the project</h3>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Team: SoftBlob, 13 people (5 programmers, 3 level designers, 4 graphics artists)<br>
                    Genre: 3D Action RPG<br>
                    Duration: 14 weeks half time<br>
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The first proper 3D-game I’ve been a part of developing.<br>
                    There is a lot to consider in a 3D-game that I didn’t expect. Surprises that made the group struggle a lot.<br>
                    The engine, IronWrought was built as the project moved along, in parallel with our 3D programming course.

                <h3>Debug Tool: LineInstance</h3>
                <p>
                    Was used to draw colliders and visualize the navigation mesh.<br>
                    Similar to how we created model. LineInstance holds the data of a Line (geometry data)<br>
                    and a transform. The line is created in a Factory so that similar Lines are shared.

                <h3>Modelviewer</h3>
                <p>
                    Collaboration with Emanuel Niklasson.<br>
                    Part of the requirements for the project was to create a modelviewer/ showroom.<br>
                    We didn’t have any GUI-library at our in the engine, instead of adding one we thought it<br>
                    would be faster to throw something together using the console window for input.<br>
                    Clunky but got the job done.<br>
                    We used the std::recursive_directory_iterator to search our project directory for any<br>
                    fbxes we then filtered the results based on the suffixes the engine used.<br>
                    It was later also used to preview VFX:es upon request by Nicolas Risberg.

                </p>
                <h3>Animations</h3>
                <p>
                    I took over the work on getting animations up and running. <br>
                    I wrapped the existing animation controller into a component. Created a pipeline<br>
                    for it. Spent some time debugging animations made by our graphics artist to figure<br>
                    out why some animations didn’t work with IronWrought.

                <h3>Game Object and Component system</h3>
                <p>
                    GameObject and Component system<br>
                    Developed with Axel Savage and Alexander Matthäi.<br>
                    The group decided on creating and using our own component system instead of using<br>
                    an external solution, like EnTT. Even if ours would be barebones.<br>
                    We took inspiration from Unity for how we would want our interface to be, which<br>
                    worked well for what we needed.
