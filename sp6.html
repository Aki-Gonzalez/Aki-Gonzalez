                <h3>Debug Tool: Line Drawer</h3>
                <p>
                    In our previous projects made with Tga2D we had a convenient debugging tool to draw lines between 2 points or draw shapes such as circles and squares.
                    I wanted to recreate a similar feature for IronWrought. To do so I created a system with a structure and interface similar to how IronWrought handles model creation.
                    <br>
                    <i>CLine</i> that holds DirectX11 data for topology, vertices, input layout and more.<br>
                    <i>CLineInstance</i> that holds a pointer to a <i>CLine</i> along with a transform.<br> 
                    <i>CLineFactory</i> which creates a <i>CLine</i> based on a pre-determined shape or a set of points that describe a polygon.<br>
                    A forward renderer that handles only <i>CLineInstances</i>.<br>
                    <br>
                    I created functions for the shapes of the colliders we used for the project: square, circle and triangle.
                    When the navigation mesh was being worked on I was requested to add support for visualizing it, resulting in the <code>CreatePolygon()</code> function.<br>
                    Ability, player and enemy colliders were visualised to help debugging.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There is room for improvement: streamlining creation of <i>CLines</i> and <i>CLineInstances</i>, support for more shapes and memory optimizations.

                <h3>Modelviewer</h3>
                <p>
                   
                    During development of SPITE: Bloodloss, our engine IronWrought was being put together alongside development of the game and the graphics artists needed a way to view models without having to load the game directly.
                    The tool was put together using existing systems with the goal being to get it up and running as fast as possible.<br>
                    <br>
                    To get all the FBX files from the asset directory we recursively traverse it, if a file with the correct extension is found
                    it's added to a list that holds all paths. Loading and swapping the model based on index.<br>
                    <br>
                    Later on a filter for skinned models was added so animations could be tested without having to be implemented in the game and for troubleshooting.
                    <a href="https://nicolas-risberg.github.io/">Nicolas Risberg</a> who was working on the VFX system had the idea to also support VFX playback through the modelviewer, he also suggsted
                    adding a display option for the in-game HUD that auto played any animations it had.
                    <br>
                    Developed along with Emanuel Niklasson, from another team, for both our teams to use.

                <h3>Game Object and Component System</h3>
                <p>
                    For IronWrought the team knew we wanted some form component system, some of us had created and worked with one in a previous project and were eager to work with it again.<br>
                    A <i>CGameObject</i> holds any number of <i>CComponents</i>, each holding some logic. This was the core of the system we used, more functionalty was added later on.<br>
                    <br>
                    We used <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> as a reference for the type of interface we wanted, with e.g: <code>GetComponent()</code>. 
                    <code>GetComponent(), TryGetComponent(), RemoveComponent()</code> all use typeid: <code>const std::type_info& type = typeid(T);</code>, to identify which component is requested.<br>
                    Since a <i>CComponent</i> could require any number of parameters in its constructor so a variadic template was used to remove the need for separate functions to set data.<br>
                    Developed with <a href="https://www.alexander-matthai.com/">Alexander Matth√§i</a> and <a href="https://www.axelsavage.net/">Axel Savage</a>.<br>
